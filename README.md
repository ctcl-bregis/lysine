# Lysine
Lysine is a preprocessor scripting language for webpages meant to replace Sass in my projects. Lysine also contains a Markdown file processor inspired by Comrak with extra features.

## Name
The name is based on the mechanism of action of the medication, lisdexamfetamine. An analogy would be: Lisdexamfetamine; lysine markup is metabolized by red blood cells; is compiled into dextroamphetamine; CSS.

The name is mostly inspired by my interest in ADHD treatments along with it being one of the most well known examples of lysine being used in a prodrug.

## Supplementary
The color to represent Lysine is #FF6600. 

## File Extensions

Lysine may make use of multiple different file extensions

- .lisc - Lysine CSS
- .lism - Lysine Markdown
