# Lysine
Lysine is a preprocessor/templating scripting language for webpages.

This repository currently contains compilier implementations for the following:
* Rust
* Python

The two current language implementations are forks of existing compiliers in order to be able to use Lysine in projects quickly.

In the future, rewrites may be done to have all original code.

## Rust
The Rust version of the compilier is currently a fork of Tera with some modifications.

## Python
The Python version of the compilier is currently a fork of Jinja2 with some modifications.
