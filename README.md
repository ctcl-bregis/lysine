# Lysine
Lysine is a preprocessor scripting language for webpages meant to replace SCSS in my projects.

This repository contains the definitions of the language and not the actual compiliers.

## Name
The name is based on the mechanism of action of the medication, lisdexamfetamine. An analogy would be lisdexamfetamine (lysine markup) is metabolized by red blood cells (compiled) into dextroamphetamine (CSS). The basis of the name is mostly inspired by my interest in ADHD treatments along with it being one of the most well known examples of lysine being used this way.

## Branding
The color to represent Lysine is #FF6600. The secondary color is #0000FF.
